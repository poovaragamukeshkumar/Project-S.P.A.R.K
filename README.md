# 🚀 Project S.P.A.R.K

**Simulated Penetration And Response Kit (SPARK)** is a cybersecurity simulation project designed to help students and enthusiasts explore the lifecycle of cyberattacks through practical red-team (attack) and blue-team (defense) workflows.

## 📌 Objectives

- Simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios
- Learn incident detection, log analysis, and response
- Build automated scripts for both offensive and defensive tasks
- Document outcomes, insights, and challenges

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a hands-on cybersecurity simulation environment.
- Practice red teaming (attacks) and blue teaming (defense).
- Learn real-world penetration testing, monitoring, and incident response.
- Strengthen cybersecurity skills, teamwork, and project experience.
- Create a reusable open-source framework for future learners.

## 📦 Project Scope
- **Red Team**: Recon, Exploits, Post-Exploitation.
- **Blue Team**: Monitoring, Detection, Response Playbooks.
- **Lab Setup**: VMs, tools, scripts, network simulation.
- **Docs & Reports**: Setup guides, activity logs, outcomes.
